## Overview

**Sentinel Trace** leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to perform thorough code vulnerability assessments. Unlike traditional scanning tools, Sentinel Trace employs a Deep Reasoning Protocol that allows it to "think out loud." This means it generates detailed thought logs and structured reports that provide insights beyond standard scans. By integrating metacognitive processes, Sentinel Trace ensures transparency and clarity in its analyses.

## Features

- **Deep Reasoning Protocol**: Our unique approach to vulnerability analysis allows for more insightful results.
- **Transparent Reporting**: Users receive detailed logs of the analysis process, promoting trust and understanding.
- **Structured Vulnerability Reports**: The tool generates easy-to-understand reports that highlight potential issues and recommended fixes.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Get recommendations that are based on advanced AI reasoning, making the tool smarter over time.
- **Integration with OWASP Standards**: Aligns with the Open Web Application Security Project guidelines for effective vulnerability management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with developers in mind, making it easy to navigate and understand.
